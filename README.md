VJScript is a npm package that is created in scope to allow writing VScript code in JavaScript. It provides the same API, that is provided through Squirrel language. The JavaScript code is then translated into Squirrel to allow it to be run inside of Team Fortress 2 or any other game that supports VScript.

It is currently in heavy development. More information will be provided in due time.
